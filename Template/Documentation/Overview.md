# Project Overview

## 1. Introduction
Brief explanation of the product:
- What it is
- Who it is for
- The core problem it solves
- High-level value proposition

---

## 2. Key Features
List the major features at a high level (no technical depth):
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3
- etc.

---

## 3. System Summary
High-level explanation of how the system works:
- Core components
- Major workflows (text chat, voice calls, video calls, knowledge upload, etc.)
- Any AI-powered capabilities

---

## 4. Architecture Snapshot
(Do NOT put detailed diagrams here — that goes into HLD.)
Include:
- A single simple diagram **OR** a list of system modules  
- Summary of backend, frontend, infra, AI stack

Example:
- Backend → FastAPI  
- Frontend → Next.js  
- RAG → Weaviate  
- Realtime → LiveKit  
- Agents → LangGraph/CrewAI  
- Storage → S3/Redis/Postgres/Mongo  

---

## 5. Key User Roles
Summary of roles (without permissions matrix):
- Role 1
- Role 2
- Role 3

---

## 6. Product Scope
Clearly define the boundaries:
### 6.1 In Scope
What the product WILL deliver.

### 6.2 Out of Scope
What it will NOT cover (critical to avoid scope creep).

---

## 7. High-Level Module Breakdown
Short 1–2 line descriptions:
- Authentication
- Twin Management
- Conversations (Text/Voice/Video)
- Knowledge Base
- Billing/Subscriptions
- Analytics
- Admin Panel (if applicable)

---

## 8. Tech Stack Summary
Brief list:
- Programming languages
- Frameworks
- Databases
- Storage
- Messaging/Queues
- AI/ML frameworks
- DevOps tools

---

## 9. Deployment & Environment Summary
Simple description of:
- Environments (dev/stage/prod)

(Do NOT include CI/CD or scaling here.)

---

## 10. Document Structure
List all documents in the project so readers know where to go next:

- **SRS** → Requirements  
- **HLD** → System architecture  
- **LLD** → Technical implementation  
- **Technical Documentation** → APIs, data models, configs  
- **System Test Cases** → QA and end-to-end validation  

---

## 11. Future Roadmap (High-level only)
